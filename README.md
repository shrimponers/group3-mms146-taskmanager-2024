Our group has decided to create a task manager for our project. Task manager software consists of programs that list tasks and schedules so that people can plan and achieve their goals more effectively. Itâ€™s very useful in real life, especially for students like us. By collaborating using this type of program, we'll also be able to work more efficiently in real life!
